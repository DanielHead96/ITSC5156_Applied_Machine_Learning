The models folder does not include the variables.data files because they were over 100MB and thus too large for GitHub. 

The data folder includes the data that was downloaded from the email spam dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishabharathi/email-spam-dataset?resource=download

The images folder includes images that were saved for the paper or presentation.
